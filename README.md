# Disaster-Tweet-Classification-using-LSTM
Create a ML model for classifying the tweets into disaster and non disaster using LSTM.

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

# Dataset:
Each sample in the train and test set has the following information:
* The text of a tweet
* A keyword from that tweet (although this may be blank!)
* The location the tweet was sent from (may also be blank)

#### Files:
* train.csv - the training set
* test.csv - the test set

#### Columns:
* id - a unique identifier for each tweet. 
* text - the text of the tweet. 
* location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank). 
* keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank). 
* target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
